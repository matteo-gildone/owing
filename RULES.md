# Owing - Learning project rules

## Purpuse
This project is for learning Go independently.
Every line of code must be written and understood by me.

## AI usage contract

### ✅ ALLOWED
- "Does this approach make sense?"
- "Is this idiomatic Go?"
- "Review this code I wrote - what's wrong?"
- "What's the stdlib package for X?"
- Design discussion before coding
- Code review after coding

### ❌ FORBIDDEN
- "Implement this function"
- "Generate code for X"
- "Write this feature"
- Copy/pasting AI-generated code
- Using AI as a pair programmer

## The test
After any AI interaction: "Did i write this code myself?"
- YES -> follow the rules ✅
- NO -> broke the contract ❌

## Why this rules
I want to build indipendent Go fluency.
I want to own every line of this codebase.
I want to be able to explain every decision
